description: "Sanin (Russian: Санин) is a novel by the Russian writer Mikhail Artsybashev.\
  \ It has an interesting history being written by a 26-year-old in 1904 – at the\
  \ peak of the various changes in Russian society (democratic activities, first democratically-elected\
  \ Duma, as well as the Russian Revolution of 1905). It was published and criticized\
  \ in 1907, the year of one of the most horrific political reactions in Russian history.\
  \ In the early 1900s Russia society was heavily influenced by religions, primarily\
  \ the Russian Orthodox Church. Though there were many other religions such as Uniate\
  \ Catholics, Judaism, and Muslims, none of them condoned an open expression of sexuality.\
  \ By 1908 the novel was no longer being produced due to censorship. It was banned\
  \ as a \"work of pornography\" (Otto Boele). When Artsybashev emigrated to Poland\
  \ after the Russian Revolution of 1917, he was condemned by the Soviet authorities\
  \ and his books were banned from publication, only to be revealed afresh to readers\
  \ in the 1990s.\nSanin is a novel of true originality of form and content. Its hero,\
  \ twenty-something Sanin, after a long absence from home, comes back to visit his\
  \ mother and sister. Sanin deals with sex and sexual activity throughout the novel.\
  \ The main character Sanin and his sister Lida dabble in premarital sex. Lida describes\
  \ her experience with Zarudin as her body filled with \"thrilled and shaken with\
  \ passion\". Knowing it is not the best thing for a young lady not to be married\
  \ and have relations, she's longing for another chance to experience that same passion\
  \ and lust. The novel deals with nihilism, the belief that traditional morals, ideas,\
  \ beliefs, etc., have no worth or value. One of the characters gets to a point where\
  \ he admits \"that life was the realization of freedom, and consequently that it\
  \ was natural for a man to live for enjoyment\". Lida has some remorse because of\
  \ society and their views on premarital sex, but then comes to the realization that\
  \ it is her life saying \"I wanted to do it and I did it; and I felt so happy\"\
  . During his stay Sanin meets various people, some of whom are neutral, amazed,\
  \ threatened or excited by his way of thinking about the world and human existence.\
  \ Sanin remains confident and self-assured having seduced and deflowered a local\
  \ virgin, but at the end of the book leaves town under a cloud.\nColin Wilson wrote\
  \ about Sanin:\n\n\"The book's hero sneers at the unhealthy moral preoccupations\
  \ of most Russians, and preaches a doctrine of sunlight and frank sensuality. The\
  \ book had an enormous impact on Russian youth, who were eager to put its doctrines\
  \ into practice. Probably no book in world literature has been responsible for the\
  \ loss of so many maidenheads.\"\n\nWilson added that Sanin deserves more study\
  \ in English.\nThe novelty of Sanin lies in its insertion of progressive and liberal\
  \ thoughts and ideals in the literary form of a novel. Critics in 1907 and later\
  \ in the Russian SFSR were furious to find such views as Sanin's in existence. They\
  \ put their efforts to discrediting the book, whose references to the Bible, Shakespeare,\
  \ Dickens, Dostoevsky, Nietzsche and whose precipitation of the dramatic changes\
  \ in the morality and political life of the following decades were, in their view,\
  \ dangerous for the Russian people.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
